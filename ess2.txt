It is often said that we learn from our past, but is that really true? Inequalities have existed in our society for thousands of years; from the kings verses the surfs in medieval times, to the treatment of slaves, to the inequalities of women. Today we still have people who face prejudice and inequality every day. If we really learn from our past, why does inequality still exist? Why can?t we live to the belief that ?all men are created equal?? Our society today is, however, a lot better than it was when the United States first became a nation. The examples of past inequalities have shaped today?s society because we now have an increased minority participation in the government, equal education is promised to everybody, and most people have the chance at any job they want.
In today?s government, there are 61 women in congress, and 13 in the senate. 36 blacks and 24 other minorities were also elected into congress. (congressional, 2001) When the first members of the United States congress were elected into office, there were no minorities or women included. Back then, it would be unheard of for a woman or a freed slave to help run the country. Blacks first started to be elected into congress after the civil war. This was made possible by the passage of Reconstruction Acts by congress, which enabled free male slaves to vote. Because blacks were the majority in some areas of the southern United States, it became possible for them to be elected and to hold office. Women still, however, did not have the right to vote. Jeanette Rankin, the first woman elected into congress, was voted into congress before women received the right to vote. Rankin won her seat by promising to expand voting rights to women and to ban liquor. Rankin pushed for the passing of the 19th amendment, allowing women the right to vote. In 1922, it passed. This expanded the influence of women in the U.S. government.
